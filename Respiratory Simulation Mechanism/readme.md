# Respiratory Mechanism
## Repository Description:

This repository presents an examination of respiratory mechanics simulations utilizing a tool developed by David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero in 2020. The simulation tool allows for the exploration of respiratory conditions in adults, encompassing normal, restrictive pulmonary disease, and obstructive pulmonary disease scenarios. Through graphical representations and minute ventilation comparisons, the simulator serves as a valuable resource for understanding the intricacies of respiratory mechanics.

## Introduction:

This analysis centers on leveraging the simulation tool to investigate respiratory mechanics in diverse conditions. Through simulations of normal and diseased respiratory scenarios, the goal is to unravel the effects of various pulmonary conditions on minute ventilation and ventilation patterns.

### Simulation Tool: MATLAB

The simulation tool utilized in this analysis is a user-friendly application developed on Simulink. This tool facilitates the simulation of respiratory mechanics under different conditions, providing visualizations of ventilation patterns and minute ventilation. Originating from the work of David Leonardo Rodriguez Sarmiento and Daniela Acevedo Guerrero in 2020, the simulator aims to enhance user comprehension of how respiratory mechanics respond to different scenarios.
